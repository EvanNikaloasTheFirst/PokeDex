# PokeDex

I decided to create a project which was just a generic trivial project I could find on youtube such as a calculator application. I selected this project as its something I really enjoyed watching as a child. Creating this application was a really fun journey as I gave me more exposure to working with APIs (both with AUTHkey and open APIs). This is a project younger me would've really have enjoyed to have and it was great to finally complete it.


TO USE THE APPLICATION:
Simply type in a Pokemon's name within the search bar and the following details about that pokemon will return to the screen.

Example 
1 . Pikachu
2. Click enter or click the search button
